# Data Science Application Templates

The main goal of this repository is to provide a list of a wide variety of data science application -->>templates<<--. This helped, helpes and will help me, and hopefully others, to get off the ground in terms of: how to approach a new problem and how you use a specific framework's API.

## Some important stuff about this repository
- Some ipynb and script were taken as they were (**you do not modify what is already good**)
- I tried my best to reference everything that I've used so far (**my apologies if somethiing was not referenced**)
- There are pictures that have not been properly referenced (**lack of time**)
- There is no particular order or rule I've used to classify the notebooks/scripts (**my personal use for the benefit of others**)
- The work was done to keep track of my literature review (**it is easy to forget things**)
- See the references in each file (**to know more**)
- For the ipynb files, I suggest you download them locally and use your jupyter notebook as it renders the markdown cell much better than the Git viewer.
- The ultimate goal of this is to refresh my memory about what I've learnt so far (**when I need to**)

## A note on the notebook rendering
Each notebook has two versions (all python scripts are unaffected by this convention):
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in black& white. These are flagged as `_notebook_name` and are placed in the folder named `GitHub_MD_rendering` where MD stands for MarkDown.
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in coloured. These do not have a preceding underscore.
