## A note on the notebook rendering
Each notebook has two versions (all python scripts are unaffected by this convention):

- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in black & white. These are flagged as `_notebook_name`
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in coloured. These do not have a preceding underscore.
